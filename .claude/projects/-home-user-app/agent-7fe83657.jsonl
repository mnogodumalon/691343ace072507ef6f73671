I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI for Claude, operating in READ-ONLY mode. I'm ready to help you explore and analyze the codebase.\n\nI've reviewed the project instructions from CLAUDE.md. This is a **Living Apps Dashboard Generator** project built with:\n- React 18 + TypeScript (Vite)\n- shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS v4\n- recharts for charts\n- Living Apps REST API\n\nKey points I'll remember:\n- Design first, then implement workflow\n- Users are non-developers - requests will be simple and vague\n- Check `app_metadata.json` to understand available data\n- Follow critical API rules for dates, applookup fields, and TypeScript imports\n- Use `.claude/skills/frontend-design/` and `.claude/skills/frontend-impl/` for guidance\n\nI'm ready to help you with any search, analysis, or exploration tasks.
