Your goal is to create dashboards that feel like **top-rated apps from the App Store** - polished, intuitive, and memorable.\n\nYour output is `design_brief.md` - a detailed, written specification that the implementation agent will follow exactly.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Why Markdown, Not JSON\n\nYou write a **design brief** in Markdown because:\n\n1. **Explains WHY** - You can explain your reasoning, which helps the implementer understand intent\n2. **Reads as instructions** - The implementer treats it as guidance, not just data\n3. **Allows nuance** - You can describe visual details that don't fit in JSON fields\n4. **Prevents misinterpretation** - Explicit descriptions leave no room for \"creative interpretation\"\n\n---\n\n## Design Standard: App Store Quality\n\nYour designs must meet the quality bar of **the best apps in the App Store**:\n\n- **Layouts that feel native** to each device (not just \"responsive\")\n- **Information architecture** that makes sense instantly\n- **Touch targets and interactions** designed for each platform\n- **Visual hierarchy** that guides the eye naturally\n- **Distinctive details** that make the app memorable\n\nAsk yourself: **\"Would Apple feature this in the App Store?\"** If no, redesign.\n\n---\n\n## Theme: Light, Minimal, BUT Distinctive\n\n**Always use light mode.** But minimal does NOT mean generic or boring.\n\n### The Balance\n\n- **Minimalist** - Every element has a purpose, no clutter\n- **Modern** - Clean lines, subtle shadows, refined typography\n- **Neutral** - Calm, professional base\n- **BUT Distinctive** - One or two memorable details that make it special\n\n### What Makes a Minimal Design Distinctive?\n\nGreat minimal apps have subtle touches that create personality:\n\n1. **A refined color accent** - Not generic blue, but a carefully chosen tone\n2. **Thoughtful typography** - Font weight, size, and spacing that feels considered\n3. **Subtle texture or depth** - Light gradients, gentle shadows, or background patterns\n4. **Micro-details** - Icon style, border radius, spacing rhythm\n5. **Intentional white space** - Not just \"empty\" but compositionally balanced\n\n### Color Philosophy for Light Theme\n\nStart with a warm or cool base, not pure white:\n- **Warm base**: Off-white with slight cream/yellow undertone\n- **Cool base**: Off-white with slight blue/gray undertone\n\nThen add ONE carefully chosen accent color:\n- Not generic blue (#007bff) or green (#28a745)\n- Pick a specific, refined tone that fits the app's domain\n- Use sparingly - accent highlights important elements\n\n### Typography Philosophy\n\n**FORBIDDEN FONTS:** Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, Arial, Helvetica, system-ui\n\nThese fonts are so common they signal \"no design thought went into this.\"\n\n**Choose fonts that add character while remaining readable:**\n\n| App Character | Recommended Fonts |\n|--------------|-------------------|\n| Data/Analytics | Space Grotesk, IBM Plex Sans, Geist |\n| Fitness/Health | Outfit, Nunito Sans, DM Sans |\n| Finance | Source Serif 4, Newsreader, IBM Plex Serif |\n| Creative | Syne, Bricolage Grotesque, Cabinet Grotesk |\n| Professional | Source Sans 3, Plus Jakarta Sans, Manrope |\n\n**Typography creates hierarchy through:**\n- Extreme weight differences (300 vs 700, not 400 vs 500)\n- Size jumps (24px vs 14px, not 16px vs 14px)\n- Careful letter-spacing adjustments\n\n---\n\n## Layout Design (MOST IMPORTANT!)\n\nLayout is the foundation of good UX. Spend the most time here.\n\n**⚠️ The #1 reason dashboards look like \"AI slop\" is a boring, symmetrical grid layout.** Real designers create visual tension and flow. Your layout must feel hand-crafted by a senior product designer for THIS specific app.\n\n### Think Like a Product Designer\n\nBefore drawing anything, answer:\n\n1. **What is the ONE thing users must see first?**\n   - This becomes your hero element - the visual anchor\n   - Everything else supports this\n\n2. **What actions do users take most often?**\n   - The #1 action becomes your Primary Action Button (REQUIRED!)\n   - Maximum 1-2 taps/clicks to reach\n   - Position for thumb reach on mobile\n   - This dashboard is interactive, NOT read-only!\n\n3. **What is the user's mental model?**\n   - How do they naturally think about this data?\n   - Your layout should mirror their thinking\n\n4. **What is the user's workflow?**\n   - What sequence of actions do they take?\n   - How can the layout support this flow?\n\n---\n\n### Creating Visual Interest\n\nThe goal is a layout that feels **intentionally designed for THIS app**, not a generic template.\n\n**The core principle:** Every layout needs at least ONE element that creates visual interest - something that breaks the monotony of identical boxes. This could be:\n\n- **Size variation** - One element noticeably larger than others (the hero)\n- **Weight variation** - Mix of bold and subtle elements\n- **Spacing variation** - Tighter grouping within sections, more space between\n- **Format variation** - Mix of cards, inline text, badges (not everything in cards)\n- **Typography variation** - Different sizes that create clear hierarchy\n\n### Symmetric vs Asymmetric Layouts\n\n**Both can work well.** Choose based on what suits the app:\n\n**Symmetric layouts work when:**\n- The app has 2-4 equally important metrics\n- The data is naturally balanced (e.g., income vs expenses)\n- A calm, orderly feel fits the app's purpose\n\n**Asymmetric layouts work when:**\n- There's ONE thing that matters most (clear hero)\n- You want to create visual flow/movement\n- The data has natural hierarchy\n\n**Either way, add visual interest:**\n- If symmetric: vary element sizes, use different treatments for hero\n- If asymmetric: make the hierarchy obvious through sizing\n\n### What Makes a Layout Feel Generic\n\nAvoid these patterns that scream \"AI-generated template\":\n\n- **Everything the same size** - All KPIs identical, all cards identical\n- **No clear hero** - Nothing stands out as most important\n- **Uniform spacing everywhere** - No visual grouping\n- **Only cards** - No inline elements, no variation in container styles\n- **No breathing room** - Elements crammed together without whitespace\n\n### Mobile Layout (Phone)\n\nDesign mobile as a **completely separate experience**, not a squeezed desktop.\n\n**Mobile Principles:**\n- **Vertical flow** - One column, top to bottom\n- **Thumb-friendly** - Important actions in bottom half\n- **Focused** - Show less, but show it well\n- **Progressive** - Reveal details on interaction\n- **Hero stands out** - Make the most important element visually dominant\n\n**Mobile Questions:**\n- What needs to be LARGER for comfortable touch?\n- Where should the primary action live? (Thumb zone)\n- How does the hero stand out from other content?\n- How should content be reorganized to fit the vertical flow?\n\nNote: Only hide elements on mobile if they're truly impossible to use on a phone. Users expect the same functionality on all devices.\n\n**Mobile Layout Ideas:**\n- Hero KPI takes entire top fold, everything else scrolls below\n- Compact horizontal scroll for secondary KPIs\n- Inline summary row (not cards) for quick stats\n- Bottom sheet for additional details\n\n### Desktop Layout\n\nDesign desktop to take full advantage of horizontal space.\n\n**Desktop Principles:**\n- **Use the width** - Multi-column layouts where appropriate\n- **Horizontal density** - Side-by-side information\n- **Hover reveals** - Secondary info on hover\n- **Peripheral vision** - Context without overwhelming\n- **Keyboard awareness** - Power user shortcuts\n\n**Desktop Questions:**\n- How does the extra width add value? (Not just stretching)\n- Which side gets the hero element?\n- What information benefits from side-by-side comparison?\n- What hover states add useful information?\n- Where can you break the grid intentionally?\n\n**Desktop Layout Ideas:**\n- Wide left column (hero + chart) + narrow right column (recent activity)\n- Full-width hero banner, then 3 unequal columns below\n- Sidebar with key stats, main area with detailed views\n- Sticky summary header while scrolling through details\n\n---\n\n## Information Hierarchy\n\nUsers scan, they don't read. Design for scanning.\n\n**Hierarchy Levels:**\n1. **Primary** - ONE thing that matters most (largest, boldest)\n2. **Secondary** - Supporting information (medium)\n3. **Tertiary** - Details, metadata (smallest, muted)\n\n**Hierarchy Tools:**\n- Size (larger = more important)\n- Weight (bolder = more important)\n- Color (accent = important/interactive)\n- Position (top/left = seen first)\n- Space (more whitespace = more important)\n\n---\n\n## Your Output: design_brief.md\n\nWrite a detailed design brief in Markdown.

What proportions?\n- Where does the eye go first, second, third?\n- What creates visual interest in this layout?]\n\n### Section Layout\n[Describe what goes where:\n- Top area: [what content]\n- Main content area: [what content]\n- Supporting areas: [what content]\nInclude proportions if using multi-column layout.]\n\n### What Appears on Hover\n[What extra information is revealed when hovering over elements?]\n\n### Clickable/Interactive Areas (if applicable)\n[If any elements should open detail views when clicked, note them here.\nOnly add where it provides additional useful information.]\n\n---\n\n## 6. Components\n\n### Hero KPI\nThe MOST important metric that users see first.\n\n- **Title:** [Name]\n- **Data source:** [Which app to query]\n- **Calculation:** [How to calculate: sum, count, latest, etc.]\n- **Display:** [How it looks - large number? With icon? Progress ring?]\n- **Context shown:** [What comparison? Goal progress? Trend?]\n- **Why this is the hero:** [Explain why this matters most to users]\n\n### Secondary KPIs\n[For each secondary KPI:]\n\n**[KPI Name]**\n- Source: [App]\n- Calculation: [How]\n- Format: [number/currency/percent]\n- Display: [Card? Inline? Size?]\n\n### Chart (if applicable)\n- **Type:** [line/bar/area - and WHY this type]\n- **Title:** [Chart title]\n- **What question it answers:** [Why does the user need this chart?]\n- **Data source:** [App]\n- **X-axis:** [Field, label]\n- **Y-axis:** [Field, label]\n- **Mobile simplification:** [How is it simplified for small screens?]\n\n### Lists/Tables (if applicable)\n[For each list:]\n\n**[Section Name]**\n- Purpose: [Why users need this]\n- Source: [App]\n- Fields shown: [Which fields]\n- Mobile style: [cards/simple list]\n- Desktop style: [table/cards]\n- Sort: [By what field]\n- Limit: [How many items]\n\n### Primary Action Button (REQUIRED!)\n\n**⚠️ Every dashboard MUST have a primary action.** This is NOT a read-only view!\n\nUsers need to DO things from the dashboard, not just look at data. The most common action should be one tap/click away.\n\nThink about what action users perform most often:\n- Adding a new record (workout, meal, expense, etc.)\n- Logging something (weight, progress, status)\n- Starting a process (timer, session, etc.)\n\n**This section is REQUIRED - do not skip it or write \"None\"!**\n\n- **Label:** [Action-oriented text, e.g. \"Workout starten\", \"Mahlzeit hinzufügen\"]\n- **Action:** [add_record | navigate - specify which]\n- **Target app:** [Which Living Apps app receives the data]\n- **What data:** [What fields will the form contain]\n- **Mobile position:** [bottom_fixed (recommended) | header | fab]\n- **Desktop position:** [header | sidebar | inline]\n- **Why this action:** [Why is this the most important thing users do?]\n\nThe implementation skill knows how to create forms that send data to Living Apps API.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Visual Details\n\n### Border Radius\n[sharp (4px) / rounded (8px) / pill (16px+)]\n\n### Shadows\n[none / subtle / elevated - describe the shadow style]\n\n### Spacing\n[compact / normal / spacious - how much breathing room?]\n\n### Animations\n- **Page load:** [none / fade / stagger]\n- **Hover effects:** [What happens on hover?]\n- **Tap feedback:** [What happens on tap?]\n\n---\n\n## 8. CSS Variables (Copy Exactly!)\n\nThe implementer MUST copy these values exactly into `src/index.css`:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --background: hsl(...);\n  --foreground: hsl(...);\n  --card: hsl(...);\n  --card-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --popover: hsl(...);\n  --popover-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --primary: hsl(...);\n  --primary-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --secondary: hsl(...);\n  --secondary-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --muted: hsl(...);\n  --muted-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --accent: hsl(...);\n  --accent-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --destructive: hsl(...);\n  --border: hsl(...);\n  --input: hsl(...);\n  --ring: hsl(...);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9. Implementation Checklist\n\nThe implementer should verify:\n- [ ] Font loaded from URL above\n- [ ] All CSS variables copied exactly\n- [ ] Mobile layout matches Section 4\n- [ ] Desktop layout matches Section 5\n- [ ] Hero element is prominent as described\n- [ ] Colors create the mood described in Section 2\n```\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ How Colors Are Applied (Critical!)\n\nYour colors are mapped to CSS variables. The implementation agent uses them directly.\n\n**Color Mapping:**\n\n| Your design_brief color | CSS Variable |\n|-------------------------|--------------|\n| `background` | `--background` |\n| `foreground` | `--foreground` |\n| `card` | `--card` |\n| `card_foreground` | `--card-foreground` |\n| `primary` | `--primary` |\n| `primary_foreground` | `--primary-foreground` |\n| `accent` | `--accent` |\n| `muted` | `--muted` |\n| `muted_foreground` | `--muted-foreground` |\n| `border` | `--border` |\n| `negative` | `--destructive` |\n\n**Light Theme Contrast Rules:**\n- `foreground` must be dark (readable on light backgrounds)\n- `card` can be white or slightly off-white\n- `card_foreground` must be dark\n- `primary` needs sufficient contrast for buttons\n\n**All colors MUST be complete hsl() functions:**\n```\n\"background\": \"hsl(40 20% 98%)\"   // ✅ Complete function\n\"background\": \"40 20% 98%\"        // ❌ Will break!\n```\n\n---\n\n## Quality Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing design_brief.md:\n\n### Distinctiveness\n- [ ] Would a designer recognize this as intentionally designed (not default)?\n- [ ] Is there at least ONE memorable visual detail?\n- [ ] Is the font choice appropriate and NOT from forbidden list?\n- [ ] Does the color accent feel considered, not generic?\n\n### Layout & UX (CRITICAL FOR AVOIDING AI SLOP!)\n- [ ] Is there ONE clear hero element that stands out?\n- [ ] Is there visual interest? (size variation, typography hierarchy, spacing variation)\n- [ ] NOT everything the same size - some variation exists\n- [ ] Is mobile designed FOR mobile (not just smaller)?\n- [ ] Does desktop use horizontal space meaningfully?\n- [ ] Would this get featured in the App Store?\n\n### Interactivity\n- [ ] Is the primary action clearly defined?\n- [ ] Are clickable elements marked where drill-down adds value?\n\n### Information\n- [ ] Is the visual hierarchy clear?\n- [ ] Are all relevant KPIs included?\n\n### Clarity\n- [ ] Is every section detailed enough that someone else could implement it?\n- [ ] Are there WHY explanations for major decisions?\n- [ ] Are the CSS variables complete and ready to copy?\n- [ ] Is the Layout Strategy section filled out with specific proportions?\n\n### Technical\n- [ ] Are all colors complete hsl() functions?\n- [ ] Is contrast sufficient for readability?\n- [ ] Are all required colors defined?\n\n---\n\n## Remember\n\n1. **Write for the implementer** - They will follow your words exactly\n2. **Explain WHY** - Context helps them understand intent\n3. **Be specific** - \"Large number\" is vague, \"48px bold\" is specific\n4. **Minimal ≠ Generic** - Minimal can be distinctive\n5. **Layout is everything** - 80% of design time on layout\n6. **Visual interest is required** - Vary sizes, not everything identical\n7. **Mobile ≠ Small Desktop** - Separate experiences\n8. **One memorable detail** - What makes this special?\n9. **App Store quality** - Would Apple feature this?\n","numLines":613,"startLine":1,"totalLines":613}}}

App Analysis\n\n### What This App Does\nThis is a massage studio management system that handles appointment bookings, customer data, and service catalog management. The owner uses it to track incoming appointment requests, manage their customer base, and maintain their service offerings including special wellness passes and voucher promotions.\n\n### Who Uses This\nA massage therapist or small wellness studio owner who needs a quick overview of their business: pending bookings, upcoming appointments, customer activity, and revenue from their services. They check this dashboard multiple times daily, especially in the morning to plan their day.\n\n### The ONE Thing Users Care About Most\n**Today's and upcoming appointment requests** - they need to see which bookings are coming in and need confirmation. This is their daily workflow: check requests, confirm appointments, serve clients.\n\n### Primary Actions (IMPORTANT!)\n1. **Neue Terminanfrage ansehen** (View new appointment request) - Primary Action Button - opens the booking request details\n2. **Kunden kontaktieren** (Contact customer) - quick access to customer phone/email\n3. **Termin bestätigen** (Confirm appointment) - mark a request as confirmed\n\n---\n\n## 2. What Makes This Design Distinctive\n\n### Visual Identity\nThe design evokes a **spa/wellness atmosphere** with warm, earthy tones. A soft sage green accent combined with warm cream backgrounds creates a calm, professional feeling that reflects the relaxation services offered. The design feels like stepping into a peaceful wellness space - not clinical, not overly playful, but serene and trustworthy.\n\n### Layout Strategy\n- **Asymmetric layout** with a dominant left column showcasing today's key metrics and upcoming appointments\n- The **hero element** is a large \"Offene Anfragen\" (Open Requests) counter with subtle animation, immediately telling the owner \"you have X requests to handle\"\n- **Size variation is key**: The hero KPI is 3x larger than secondary metrics\n- Secondary KPIs arranged horizontally in a compact row, not stealing attention\n- Recent appointment requests list takes most space as it's the working area\n- Desktop uses sidebar for quick stats, main area for actionable content\n\n### Unique Element\nThe **appointment request cards** feature a subtle left border accent in sage green, with the customer name and service type displayed prominently. Each card has a delicate time indicator showing \"vor X Stunden\" (X hours ago) to create urgency for new requests. The cards have a hover state that slightly lifts them with a soft shadow, inviting interaction.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Theme & Colors\n\n### Font\n- **Family:** Plus Jakarta Sans\n- **URL:** `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Plus+Jakarta+Sans:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap`\n- **Why this font:** Plus Jakarta Sans has a warm, humanist quality that feels approachable and professional. Its slightly rounded terminals soften the interface without being childish - perfect for a wellness business.\n\n### Color Palette\nAll colors as complete hsl() functions:\n\n| Purpose | Color | CSS Variable |\n|---------|-------|--------------|\n| Page background | `hsl(40 30% 97%)` | `--background` |\n| Main text | `hsl(30 10% 20%)` | `--foreground` |\n| Card background | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--card` |\n| Card text | `hsl(30 10% 20%)` | `--card-foreground` |\n| Borders | `hsl(40 20% 88%)` | `--border` |\n| Primary action | `hsl(152 35% 45%)` | `--primary` |\n| Text on primary | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--primary-foreground` |\n| Accent highlight | `hsl(152 25% 92%)` | `--accent` |\n| Muted background | `hsl(40 20% 95%)` | `--muted` |\n| Muted text | `hsl(30 10% 45%)` | `--muted-foreground` |\n| Success/positive | `hsl(152 45% 40%)` | (component use) |\n| Error/negative | `hsl(0 65% 50%)` | `--destructive` |\n\n### Why These Colors\nThe warm cream background (slight yellow undertone) creates a welcoming, spa-like atmosphere. The sage green primary color represents nature, healing, and relaxation - core values of massage therapy. It's distinctive without being aggressive. The muted text colors ensure readability while maintaining the calm aesthetic.\n\n### Background Treatment\nThe page background uses a subtle warm cream (`hsl(40 30% 97%)`) - not pure white. Cards are pure white to create gentle layering. This creates depth without harsh contrasts, maintaining the peaceful atmosphere.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mobile Layout (Phone)\n\nDesign mobile as a COMPLETELY SEPARATE experience, not squeezed desktop.\n\n### Layout Approach\nMobile prioritizes the hero KPI at the top, followed by a horizontally scrollable row of secondary metrics, then the full-height appointment list. The hero takes significant visual space to immediately communicate status.\n\n### What Users See (Top to Bottom)\n\n**Header:**\n- App name \"Mein Massage-Studio\" left-aligned, medium weight\n- Small profile icon right (decorative)\n- Clean, minimal - just 48px height\n\n**Hero Section (The FIRST thing users see):**\n- Large rounded card taking ~35% of viewport\n- Central large number (64px, weight 700) showing open appointment requests count\n- Label below: \"Offene Anfragen\"\n- Subtle pulsing dot animation if count > 0 to draw attention\n- Background uses the accent color (`--accent`) for visual pop\n- WHY: This immediately answers \"Do I have work to do?\" which is the first question every morning\n\n**Section 2: Quick Stats Row**\n- Horizontal scroll row with 3 compact stat pills\n- \"Heute: X Termine\" (Today's appointments)\n- \"Diese Woche: X\" (This week total)\n- \"Kunden: X\" (Total customers)\n- Each pill: icon + number + label, ~100px wide\n- Light border, white background\n- Designed to be glanceable, not tap targets\n\n**Section 3: Terminanfragen (Appointment Requests)**\n- Section header \"Neue Anfragen\" with count badge\n- Vertically scrollable card list\n- Each card shows:\n  - Customer name (bold, 16px)\n  - Service name (muted, 14px)\n  - Requested datetime (muted, 14px)\n  - Time since request badge (\"vor 2 Std.\")\n- Left accent border on each card (sage green)\n- Tap to expand details\n\n**Bottom Navigation / Action:**\n- Fixed bottom button: \"Neue Buchung\" (sage green, full width minus padding)\n- This allows manual booking entry when someone calls\n- 56px height, rounded corners\n\n### Mobile-Specific Adaptations\n- KPI cards become horizontal scroll instead of grid\n- Appointment list is the primary scrollable content\n- No chart on mobile - space is better used for actionable list\n- Customer details shown on card tap (sheet slides up)\n\n### Touch Targets\n- All cards minimum 56px touch height\n- Bottom action button 56px height\n- Adequate spacing between list items (12px)\n\n### Interactive Elements\n- Appointment cards tap to reveal full details (customer contact, notes, service details)\n- Long press on appointment card shows quick actions (call, email)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Desktop Layout\n\n### Overall Structure\nTwo-column asymmetric layout:\n- **Left sidebar (280px fixed):** Hero KPI + secondary stats stacked vertically\n- **Main content (flexible):** Appointment requests list + optional chart\n\nEye flow: Hero KPI (top-left) → Secondary stats → Appointment list header → List content\n\n### Section Layout\n\n**Left Sidebar (280px):**\n- Hero KPI card at top (large, prominent)\n  - Takes ~200px height\n  - Large number centered\n  - Accent background\n- Below: 3 stat cards stacked vertically\n  - \"Termine heute\"\n  - \"Termine diese Woche\"\n  - \"Kunden gesamt\"\n- Each stat card: 80px height, white background, subtle border\n\n**Main Content Area:**\n- Header row: \"Terminanfragen\" title + \"Neue Buchung\" button (right-aligned)\n- Below header: Filter/sort options (date range, status)\n- Main list: Appointment request cards in a single column\n  - Cards are wider, showing more info inline\n  - Customer name, service, datetime, contact info all visible\n  - Action buttons visible on hover (confirm, contact, decline)\n- Optional: Bottom area could show weekly booking chart\n\n### What Appears on Hover\n- Appointment cards: subtle lift + shadow + action buttons appear\n- Stat cards: slight scale (1.02) with transition\n- Action buttons: color intensifies\n\n### Clickable/Interactive Areas\n- Appointment cards click to open detail modal with full customer info and booking notes\n- Customer name is a link to customer profile (if exists)\n- Phone/email icons are direct action links\n\n---\n\n## 6. Components\n\n### Hero KPI\nThe MOST important metric that users see first.\n\n- **Title:** Offene Anfragen\n- **Data source:** terminanfrage app\n- **Calculation:** Count of all records (represents pending requests)\n- **Display:** Large centered number (64px mobile, 72px desktop) with label below\n- **Context shown:** If > 0, show subtle pulsing indicator; if 0, show checkmark icon\n- **Why this is the hero:** This immediately answers the owner's morning question: \"Do I have bookings to process?\" It drives their daily workflow.\n\n### Secondary KPIs\n\n**Termine heute (Today's Appointments)**\n- Source: terminanfrage (filtered by wunschtermin = today)\n- Calculation: Count where date matches today\n- Format: number\n- Display: Compact card with calendar icon\n\n**Termine diese Woche (This Week's Appointments)**\n- Source: terminanfrage (filtered by wunschtermin within current week)\n- Calculation: Count where date is within current week\n- Format: number\n- Display: Compact card with calendar-week icon\n\n**Kunden gesamt (Total Customers)**\n- Source: kundendaten\n- Calculation: Total count of records\n- Format: number\n- Display: Compact card with users icon\n\n### Chart (if applicable)\n- **Type:** Bar chart - shows volume per day, easy to read at a glance\n- **Title:** Buchungen diese Woche\n- **What question it answers:** \"Which days are busiest? Is my week filling up?\"\n- **Data source:** terminanfrage\n- **X-axis:** Day of week (Mo, Di, Mi, Do, Fr, Sa, So)\n- **Y-axis:** Number of appointments\n- **Mobile simplification:** Hidden on mobile to prioritize list; can be accessed via tap on \"Diese Woche\" stat\n\n### Lists/Tables\n\n**Terminanfragen (Appointment Requests)**\n- Purpose: The working list - users process these requests daily\n- Source: terminanfrage app\n- Fields shown:\n  - kunde_vorname + kunde_nachname (combined as full name)\n  - massageleistung (resolved from lookup to show service name)\n  - wunschtermin (formatted as \"DD.MM.YYYY HH:mm\")\n  - kunde_telefon (for quick contact)\n  - Time since creation (calculated from record metadata)\n- Mobile style: Cards with essential info, tap to expand\n- Desktop style: Cards with more visible detail, hover for actions\n- Sort: By wunschtermin descending (newest first)\n- Limit: 10 initially, \"Alle anzeigen\" button for more\n\n### Primary Action Button (REQUIRED!)\n\n- **Label:** \"Neue Buchung\"\n- **Action:** add_record\n- **Target app:** terminanfrage (app_id: 691343895f81839bc1f243fe)\n- **What data:** Form with fields:\n  - kunde_vorname (Vorname)\n  - kunde_nachname (Nachname)\n  - kunde_telefon (Telefon)\n  - e_mail_adresse (E-Mail)\n  - wunschtermin (Gewünschter Termin - datetime picker)\n  - gesamtdauer (Dauer - select: 30/45/60 min)\n  - massageleistung (Leistung - select from Leistungskatalog)\n  - anmerkungen (Anmerkungen - textarea)\n- **Mobile position:** bottom_fixed\n- **Desktop position:** header (right-aligned in main content header)\n- **Why this action:** When customers call to book, the owner needs to quickly create a booking. This is the second most common action after checking requests.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Visual Details\n\n### Border Radius\nrounded (8px) - Soft enough to feel friendly, not so round it looks childish\n\n### Shadows\nsubtle - Cards have `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)` base, hover adds `0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`\n\n### Spacing\nspacious - Generous padding (24px in cards, 16px gaps) creates breathing room that fits the wellness theme\n\n### Animations\n- **Page load:** Stagger fade-in for cards (100ms delay between each)\n- **Hover effects:** Cards lift 2px with shadow transition (200ms ease)\n- **Tap feedback:** Scale to 0.98 briefly on mobile tap\n- **Hero pulse:** Subtle scale animation on the indicator dot if requests > 0\n\n---\n\n## 8. CSS Variables (Copy Exactly!)\n\nThe implementer MUST copy these values exactly into `src/index.css`:\n\n```css\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Plus+Jakarta+Sans:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap');\n\n:root {\n  --background: hsl(40 30% 97%);\n  --foreground: hsl(30 10% 20%);\n  --card: hsl(0 0% 100%);\n  --card-foreground: hsl(30 10% 20%);\n  --popover: hsl(0 0% 100%);\n  --popover-foreground: hsl(30 10% 20%);\n  --primary: hsl(152 35% 45%);\n  --primary-foreground: hsl(0 0% 100%);\n  --secondary: hsl(40 20% 95%);\n  --secondary-foreground: hsl(30 10% 30%);\n  --muted: hsl(40 20% 95%);\n  --muted-foreground: hsl(30 10% 45%);\n  --accent: hsl(152 25% 92%);\n  --accent-foreground: hsl(152 35% 25%);\n  --destructive: hsl(0 65% 50%);\n  --border: hsl(40 20% 88%);\n  --input: hsl(40 20% 88%);\n  --ring: hsl(152 35% 45%);\n  --radius: 0.5rem;\n}\n\nbody {\n  font-family: 'Plus Jakarta Sans', sans-serif;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9.

App Analysis\n\n### What This App Does\nThis is a massage studio management system that handles appointment bookings, customer data, and service catalog management. The owner uses it to track incoming appointment requests, manage their customer base, and maintain their service offerings including special wellness passes and voucher promotions.\n\n### Who Uses This\nA massage therapist or small wellness studio owner who needs a quick overview of their business: pending bookings, upcoming appointments, customer activity, and revenue from their services. They check this dashboard multiple times daily, especially in the morning to plan their day.\n\n### The ONE Thing Users Care About Most\n**Today's and upcoming appointment requests** - they need to see which bookings are coming in and need confirmation. This is their daily workflow: check requests, confirm appointments, serve clients.\n\n### Primary Actions (IMPORTANT!)\n1. **Neue Terminanfrage ansehen** (View new appointment request) - Primary Action Button - opens the booking request details\n2. **Kunden kontaktieren** (Contact customer) - quick access to customer phone/email\n3. **Termin bestätigen** (Confirm appointment) - mark a request as confirmed\n\n---\n\n## 2. What Makes This Design Distinctive\n\n### Visual Identity\nThe design evokes a **spa/wellness atmosphere** with warm, earthy tones. A soft sage green accent combined with warm cream backgrounds creates a calm, professional feeling that reflects the relaxation services offered. The design feels like stepping into a peaceful wellness space - not clinical, not overly playful, but serene and trustworthy.\n\n### Layout Strategy\n- **Asymmetric layout** with a dominant left column showcasing today's key metrics and upcoming appointments\n- The **hero element** is a large \"Offene Anfragen\" (Open Requests) counter with subtle animation, immediately telling the owner \"you have X requests to handle\"\n- **Size variation is key**: The hero KPI is 3x larger than secondary metrics\n- Secondary KPIs arranged horizontally in a compact row, not stealing attention\n- Recent appointment requests list takes most space as it's the working area\n- Desktop uses sidebar for quick stats, main area for actionable content\n\n### Unique Element\nThe **appointment request cards** feature a subtle left border accent in sage green, with the customer name and service type displayed prominently. Each card has a delicate time indicator showing \"vor X Stunden\" (X hours ago) to create urgency for new requests. The cards have a hover state that slightly lifts them with a soft shadow, inviting interaction.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Theme & Colors\n\n### Font\n- **Family:** Plus Jakarta Sans\n- **URL:** `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Plus+Jakarta+Sans:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap`\n- **Why this font:** Plus Jakarta Sans has a warm, humanist quality that feels approachable and professional. Its slightly rounded terminals soften the interface without being childish - perfect for a wellness business.\n\n### Color Palette\nAll colors as complete hsl() functions:\n\n| Purpose | Color | CSS Variable |\n|---------|-------|--------------|\n| Page background | `hsl(40 30% 97%)` | `--background` |\n| Main text | `hsl(30 10% 20%)` | `--foreground` |\n| Card background | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--card` |\n| Card text | `hsl(30 10% 20%)` | `--card-foreground` |\n| Borders | `hsl(40 20% 88%)` | `--border` |\n| Primary action | `hsl(152 35% 45%)` | `--primary` |\n| Text on primary | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--primary-foreground` |\n| Accent highlight | `hsl(152 25% 92%)` | `--accent` |\n| Muted background | `hsl(40 20% 95%)` | `--muted` |\n| Muted text | `hsl(30 10% 45%)` | `--muted-foreground` |\n| Success/positive | `hsl(152 45% 40%)` | (component use) |\n| Error/negative | `hsl(0 65% 50%)` | `--destructive` |\n\n### Why These Colors\nThe warm cream background (slight yellow undertone) creates a welcoming, spa-like atmosphere. The sage green primary color represents nature, healing, and relaxation - core values of massage therapy. It's distinctive without being aggressive. The muted text colors ensure readability while maintaining the calm aesthetic.\n\n### Background Treatment\nThe page background uses a subtle warm cream (`hsl(40 30% 97%)`) - not pure white. Cards are pure white to create gentle layering. This creates depth without harsh contrasts, maintaining the peaceful atmosphere.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mobile Layout (Phone)\n\nDesign mobile as a COMPLETELY SEPARATE experience, not squeezed desktop.\n\n### Layout Approach\nMobile prioritizes the hero KPI at the top, followed by a horizontally scrollable row of secondary metrics, then the full-height appointment list. The hero takes significant visual space to immediately communicate status.\n\n### What Users See (Top to Bottom)\n\n**Header:**\n- App name \"Mein Massage-Studio\" left-aligned, medium weight\n- Small profile icon right (decorative)\n- Clean, minimal - just 48px height\n\n**Hero Section (The FIRST thing users see):**\n- Large rounded card taking ~35% of viewport\n- Central large number (64px, weight 700) showing open appointment requests count\n- Label below: \"Offene Anfragen\"\n- Subtle pulsing dot animation if count > 0 to draw attention\n- Background uses the accent color (`--accent`) for visual pop\n- WHY: This immediately answers \"Do I have work to do?\" which is the first question every morning\n\n**Section 2: Quick Stats Row**\n- Horizontal scroll row with 3 compact stat pills\n- \"Heute: X Termine\" (Today's appointments)\n- \"Diese Woche: X\" (This week total)\n- \"Kunden: X\" (Total customers)\n- Each pill: icon + number + label, ~100px wide\n- Light border, white background\n- Designed to be glanceable, not tap targets\n\n**Section 3: Terminanfragen (Appointment Requests)**\n- Section header \"Neue Anfragen\" with count badge\n- Vertically scrollable card list\n- Each card shows:\n  - Customer name (bold, 16px)\n  - Service name (muted, 14px)\n  - Requested datetime (muted, 14px)\n  - Time since request badge (\"vor 2 Std.\")\n- Left accent border on each card (sage green)\n- Tap to expand details\n\n**Bottom Navigation / Action:**\n- Fixed bottom button: \"Neue Buchung\" (sage green, full width minus padding)\n- This allows manual booking entry when someone calls\n- 56px height, rounded corners\n\n### Mobile-Specific Adaptations\n- KPI cards become horizontal scroll instead of grid\n- Appointment list is the primary scrollable content\n- No chart on mobile - space is better used for actionable list\n- Customer details shown on card tap (sheet slides up)\n\n### Touch Targets\n- All cards minimum 56px touch height\n- Bottom action button 56px height\n- Adequate spacing between list items (12px)\n\n### Interactive Elements\n- Appointment cards tap to reveal full details (customer contact, notes, service details)\n- Long press on appointment card shows quick actions (call, email)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Desktop Layout\n\n### Overall Structure\nTwo-column asymmetric layout:\n- **Left sidebar (280px fixed):** Hero KPI + secondary stats stacked vertically\n- **Main content (flexible):** Appointment requests list + optional chart\n\nEye flow: Hero KPI (top-left) → Secondary stats → Appointment list header → List content\n\n### Section Layout\n\n**Left Sidebar (280px):**\n- Hero KPI card at top (large, prominent)\n  - Takes ~200px height\n  - Large number centered\n  - Accent background\n- Below: 3 stat cards stacked vertically\n  - \"Termine heute\"\n  - \"Termine diese Woche\"\n  - \"Kunden gesamt\"\n- Each stat card: 80px height, white background, subtle border\n\n**Main Content Area:**\n- Header row: \"Terminanfragen\" title + \"Neue Buchung\" button (right-aligned)\n- Below header: Filter/sort options (date range, status)\n- Main list: Appointment request cards in a single column\n  - Cards are wider, showing more info inline\n  - Customer name, service, datetime, contact info all visible\n  - Action buttons visible on hover (confirm, contact, decline)\n- Optional: Bottom area could show weekly booking chart\n\n### What Appears on Hover\n- Appointment cards: subtle lift + shadow + action buttons appear\n- Stat cards: slight scale (1.02) with transition\n- Action buttons: color intensifies\n\n### Clickable/Interactive Areas\n- Appointment cards click to open detail modal with full customer info and booking notes\n- Customer name is a link to customer profile (if exists)\n- Phone/email icons are direct action links\n\n---\n\n## 6. Components\n\n### Hero KPI\nThe MOST important metric that users see first.\n\n- **Title:** Offene Anfragen\n- **Data source:** terminanfrage app\n- **Calculation:** Count of all records (represents pending requests)\n- **Display:** Large centered number (64px mobile, 72px desktop) with label below\n- **Context shown:** If > 0, show subtle pulsing indicator; if 0, show checkmark icon\n- **Why this is the hero:** This immediately answers the owner's morning question: \"Do I have bookings to process?\" It drives their daily workflow.\n\n### Secondary KPIs\n\n**Termine heute (Today's Appointments)**\n- Source: terminanfrage (filtered by wunschtermin = today)\n- Calculation: Count where date matches today\n- Format: number\n- Display: Compact card with calendar icon\n\n**Termine diese Woche (This Week's Appointments)**\n- Source: terminanfrage (filtered by wunschtermin within current week)\n- Calculation: Count where date is within current week\n- Format: number\n- Display: Compact card with calendar-week icon\n\n**Kunden gesamt (Total Customers)**\n- Source: kundendaten\n- Calculation: Total count of records\n- Format: number\n- Display: Compact card with users icon\n\n### Chart (if applicable)\n- **Type:** Bar chart - shows volume per day, easy to read at a glance\n- **Title:** Buchungen diese Woche\n- **What question it answers:** \"Which days are busiest? Is my week filling up?\"\n- **Data source:** terminanfrage\n- **X-axis:** Day of week (Mo, Di, Mi, Do, Fr, Sa, So)\n- **Y-axis:** Number of appointments\n- **Mobile simplification:** Hidden on mobile to prioritize list; can be accessed via tap on \"Diese Woche\" stat\n\n### Lists/Tables\n\n**Terminanfragen (Appointment Requests)**\n- Purpose: The working list - users process these requests daily\n- Source: terminanfrage app\n- Fields shown:\n  - kunde_vorname + kunde_nachname (combined as full name)\n  - massageleistung (resolved from lookup to show service name)\n  - wunschtermin (formatted as \"DD.MM.YYYY HH:mm\")\n  - kunde_telefon (for quick contact)\n  - Time since creation (calculated from record metadata)\n- Mobile style: Cards with essential info, tap to expand\n- Desktop style: Cards with more visible detail, hover for actions\n- Sort: By wunschtermin descending (newest first)\n- Limit: 10 initially, \"Alle anzeigen\" button for more\n\n### Primary Action Button (REQUIRED!)\n\n- **Label:** \"Neue Buchung\"\n- **Action:** add_record\n- **Target app:** terminanfrage (app_id: 691343895f81839bc1f243fe)\n- **What data:** Form with fields:\n  - kunde_vorname (Vorname)\n  - kunde_nachname (Nachname)\n  - kunde_telefon (Telefon)\n  - e_mail_adresse (E-Mail)\n  - wunschtermin (Gewünschter Termin - datetime picker)\n  - gesamtdauer (Dauer - select: 30/45/60 min)\n  - massageleistung (Leistung - select from Leistungskatalog)\n  - anmerkungen (Anmerkungen - textarea)\n- **Mobile position:** bottom_fixed\n- **Desktop position:** header (right-aligned in main content header)\n- **Why this action:** When customers call to book, the owner needs to quickly create a booking. This is the second most common action after checking requests.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Visual Details\n\n### Border Radius\nrounded (8px) - Soft enough to feel friendly, not so round it looks childish\n\n### Shadows\nsubtle - Cards have `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)` base, hover adds `0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`\n\n### Spacing\nspacious - Generous padding (24px in cards, 16px gaps) creates breathing room that fits the wellness theme\n\n### Animations\n- **Page load:** Stagger fade-in for cards (100ms delay between each)\n- **Hover effects:** Cards lift 2px with shadow transition (200ms ease)\n- **Tap feedback:** Scale to 0.98 briefly on mobile tap\n- **Hero pulse:** Subtle scale animation on the indicator dot if requests > 0\n\n---\n\n## 8.

Your ONLY job is to **implement exactly what design_brief.md describes**.\n\n## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Build a COMPLETE, PRODUCTION-READY Dashboard\n\n**This is not a prototype. This is not a demo. This is a production dashboard.**\n\nYou MUST:\n- **Implement EVERY feature** described in design_brief.md - do not skip anything\n- **Show ALL information** users need - no placeholder \"coming soon\" sections\n- **Primary action must work** - users can add/create from the dashboard\n- **Handle all states** - loading, empty, error states for every component\n- **Be ready for real users** - this goes live immediately after you build it\n\n**DO NOT:**\n- ❌ Skip features because they seem complex\n- ❌ Leave any section incomplete with \"TODO\" comments\n- ❌ Implement only the \"happy path\"\n- ❌ Create a read-only view when actions are needed\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ CRITICAL: You Do NOT Make Design Decisions\n\nAll design decisions are ALREADY MADE in `design_brief.md`. The designer wrote detailed instructions - follow them word for word.\n\n**Your job:**\n1. Read design_brief.md COMPLETELY\n2. Implement EXACTLY what it describes\n3. Do not deviate or \"improve\"\n\n**FORBIDDEN Actions:**\n- ❌ Choosing a different font than the brief specifies\n- ❌ Changing colors from the brief\n- ❌ Rearranging the layout differently than described\n- ❌ Adding components not mentioned in the brief\n- ❌ Using \"sensible defaults\" instead of what the brief says\n- ❌ Using Inter, Roboto, or system fonts (unless brief says so)\n- ❌ Interpreting the brief \"creatively\" - implement literally\n\n**The design_brief.md is written instructions from a designer. Follow them exactly.**\n\n---\n\n## Process\n\n### Step 1: Read the Design Brief COMPLETELY\n\n```bash\ncat design_brief.md\n```\n\nRead the ENTIRE brief carefully. Pay attention to:\n\n- **Section 3: Theme & Colors** → Font name, URL, and all color values\n- **Section 4: Mobile Layout** → Exact structure for phone screens\n- **Section 5: Desktop Layout** → Exact structure for computer screens\n- **Section 6: Components** → Hero KPI, secondary KPIs, charts, lists\n- **Section 7: Visual Details** → Border radius, shadows, animations\n- **Section 8: CSS Variables** → Copy these EXACTLY into src/index.css\n\nThe brief explains WHY decisions were made. This helps you understand intent, but your job is to implement what is written, not to interpret.\n\n### Step 2: Read Existing Code\n\n```bash\ncat src/types/*.ts\ncat src/services/livingAppsService.ts\n```\n\n### Step 3: Apply CSS Variables FIRST (CRITICAL!)\n\nBefore writing any React code, update the theme. Copy the CSS from **Section 8** of design_brief.md into `src/index.css`.\n\nshadcn/ui components use Tailwind CSS variables. If you don't update them, `<Card>`, `<Button>`, etc. will use **default colors** that don't match the design!\n\n```\ndesign_brief.md → src/index.css → Tailwind classes → shadcn components\n   (Section 8)      (CSS variables)   (bg-card, etc.)   (Card, Button)\n```\n\n#### Step 3a: Copy CSS Variables\n\nThe design_brief.md Section 8 contains ready-to-copy CSS. Copy it EXACTLY:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Copy ALL values from design_brief.md Section 8 */\n  --background: hsl(...);\n  --foreground: hsl(...);\n  /* etc. */\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 3b: Light Mode (Always)\n\nThe design brief uses light mode. Make sure `index.html` does NOT have `class=\"dark\"`:\n\n```html\n<html lang=\"de\">  <!-- No \"dark\" class for light theme -->\n```\n\n### Step 4: Add Font\n\nCopy the font URL from **Section 3** of design_brief.md into `index.html`:\n\n```html\n<link href=\"[URL from Section 3]\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n```\n\n### Step 5: Implement Dashboard.tsx\n\nNow implement the React component following the brief:\n\n```typescript\n// 1. Imports (always use 'import type' for types!)\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport type { AppType1, AppType2 } from '@/types/app';\nimport { LivingAppsService } from '@/services/livingAppsService';\n\n// 2. Follow Section 4 (Mobile) and Section 5 (Desktop) for layout\n// 3. Follow Section 6 for components (Hero, KPIs, Charts, Lists)\n// 4. Follow Section 7 for visual details (radius, shadows, animations)\n```\n\n### Step 6: Build and Deploy\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThen call `mcp__deploy_tools__deploy_to_github`\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Light mode defaults - used when NO .dark class */\n}\n\n.dark {\n  /* Dark mode - used when <html class=\"dark\"> */\n}\n```\n\n**Color Mapping Table:**\n\n| design_brief.md section | CSS Variable | Used by |\n|----------------------|--------------|---------|\n| `theme.colors.background` | `--background` | `bg-background`, body |\n| `theme.colors.foreground` | `--foreground` | `text-foreground`, body text |\n| `theme.colors.card` | `--card` | `<Card>` background |\n| `theme.colors.foreground` | `--card-foreground` | Text inside cards |\n| `theme.colors.primary` | `--primary` | `<Button>` default |\n| `theme.colors.accent` | `--accent` | Accent elements |\n| `theme.colors.muted` | `--muted` | Muted backgrounds |\n| `theme.colors.border` | `--border` | All borders |\n| `theme.colors.positive` | `--chart-2` | Success/positive in charts |\n| `theme.colors.negative` | `--destructive` | Error/negative |\n\n#### Step 4c: Example - Applying a Dark Theme\n\nIf design_brief.md says:\n```json\n{\n  \"theme\": {\n    \"mode\": \"dark\",\n    \"colors\": {\n      \"background\": \"hsl(215 28% 7%)\",\n      \"foreground\": \"hsl(215 10% 92%)\",\n      \"card\": \"hsl(215 25% 12%)\",\n      \"primary\": \"hsl(25 95% 53%)\",\n      \"accent\": \"hsl(173 80% 45%)\",\n      \"muted\": \"hsl(215 15% 20%)\",\n      \"border\": \"hsl(215 20% 18%)\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen update `src/index.css`:\n\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: hsl(215 28% 7%);\n  --foreground: hsl(215 10% 92%);\n  \n  --card: hsl(215 25% 12%);\n  --card-foreground: hsl(215 10% 92%);\n  \n  --popover: hsl(215 25% 12%);\n  --popover-foreground: hsl(215 10% 92%);\n  \n  --primary: hsl(25 95% 53%);\n  --primary-foreground: hsl(215 28% 7%);\n  \n  --accent: hsl(173 80% 45%);\n  --accent-foreground: hsl(215 28% 7%);\n  \n  --muted: hsl(215 15% 20%);\n  --muted-foreground: hsl(215 10% 70%);\n  \n  --border: hsl(215 20% 18%);\n  --input: hsl(215 20% 18%);\n  --ring: hsl(173 80% 45%);\n}\n```\n\nAnd update `index.html`:\n```html\n<html lang=\"de\" class=\"dark\">\n```\n\n#### ⚠️ CRITICAL: CSS Color Format\n\nThe CSS variables **MUST use complete color functions**, not raw values!\n\n**❌ WRONG - Raw values break Tailwind:**\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: 220 25% 6%;        /* ❌ Just numbers - NOT a valid CSS color! */\n  --card: 220 20% 10%;             /* ❌ Browser ignores this, uses fallback! */\n}\n```\n\n**✅ CORRECT - Complete color functions:**\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: hsl(220 25% 6%);   /* ✓ Complete hsl() function */\n  --card: hsl(220 20% 10%);        /* ✓ Tailwind can use this */\n}\n```\n\n**Why raw values fail:**\n- Tailwind reads `var(--background)` directly for `bg-background`\n- If `--background` is `220 25% 6%` (just numbers), it's NOT a valid CSS color\n- Browser ignores invalid colors → falls back to white/transparent\n- Result: Light backgrounds with dark text = invisible!\n\n**Always copy the FULL hsl() function from design_brief.md Section 8, including the function name!**\n\n#### Why This Matters\n\nWithout this step:\n- `<Card>` uses default background (light/white)\n- Text colors (from design_brief) are for dark backgrounds\n- Result: **Light text on light cards = invisible!**\n\nWith this step:\n- All shadcn components automatically use your theme colors\n- Consistent look across all UI elements\n- No need to add inline styles everywhere\n\n### Step 5: Add Font from Spec\n\nIn `index.html`, add the font URL from design_brief.md Section 3:\n```html\n<link href=\"{font_url from spec}\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n```\n\n### Step 6: Build and Test\n\n```bash\nnpm run build  # Must compile without errors\n```\n\n### Step 7: Deploy\n\n```\nCall mcp__deploy_tools__deploy_to_github\n```\n\n---\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### 1. Type Imports\n```typescript\n// ❌ WRONG\nimport { Workout } from '@/types/app';\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nimport type { Workout } from '@/types/app';\n```\n\n### 2. extractRecordId Always Has Null Check\n```typescript\nconst id = extractRecordId(record.fields.relation);\nif (!id) return;  // ✅ Always check!\n```\n\n### 3. Dates Without Seconds\n```typescript\n// For API: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM (no seconds!)\nconst dateForAPI = formData.date + 'T12:00';\n```\n\n### 4. Select Never Has Empty Value\n```typescript\n// ❌ WRONG\n<SelectItem value=\"\">None</SelectItem>\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\n<SelectItem value=\"none\">None</SelectItem>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n\nBefore completing, verify EACH item against design_brief.md:\n\n### Theme Verification (CRITICAL!)\n- [ ] Font in `index.html` is EXACTLY from design_brief.md Section 3 (NOT Inter or Roboto!)\n- [ ] Font-family in CSS matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 3\n- [ ] `index.html` has NO \"dark\" class (light theme)\n- [ ] ALL CSS variables in `src/index.css` copied EXACTLY from design_brief.md Section 8\n- [ ] Colors are complete hsl() functions (not raw values)\n\n### Layout Verification\n- [ ] Mobile layout matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 4\n- [ ] Desktop layout matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 5\n- [ ] Hero element stands out as described\n- [ ] Section order matches the brief\n\n### Components Verification\n- [ ] Hero KPI matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6 \"Hero KPI\"\n- [ ] Secondary KPIs match EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6\n- [ ] Chart matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6 \"Chart\"\n- [ ] Primary action matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6\n\n### Visual Details Verification\n- [ ] Border radius matches design_brief.md Section 7\n- [ ] Shadow style matches design_brief.md Section 7\n- [ ] Animations match design_brief.md Section 7\n\n### Technical\n- [ ] `npm run build` passes\n- [ ] No console errors\n\n### ⚠️ COMPLETENESS VERIFICATION (CRITICAL!)\n\n**You MUST verify the dashboard is 100% complete before finishing:**\n\n- [ ] **Every app in app_metadata.json is used** - no data sources ignored\n- [ ] **Primary action works** (create new record via dialog/form)\n- [ ] **Data displays correctly** (all KPIs calculated, lists populated)\n- [ ] **All states handled:**\n  - [ ] Loading states for every data fetch\n  - [ ] Empty states with helpful guidance\n  - [ ] Error states with retry options\n- [ ] **Nothing is placeholder:**\n  - [ ] No \"TODO\" comments in code\n  - [ ] No \"Coming soon\" messages\n  - [ ] No hardcoded demo data\n\n**If ANY item above is unchecked, the dashboard is NOT complete. Fix it before deploying.**\n\n---\n\n## Definition of Done\n\nThe dashboard is complete when:\n\n1. ✅ **User experience excellent**: Intuitive, clear, professional\n2. ✅ **Primary action button works** (with Dialog/Modal)\n3. ✅ All KPIs/Stats calculated correctly\n4. ✅ Loading state works (Skeleton, not empty page)\n5. ✅ Error handling implemented (friendly messages)\n6. ✅ Empty state implemented (helpful placeholders)\n7. ✅ Responsive design (Mobile + Desktop)\n8. ✅ No TypeScript errors (`npm run build`)\n9. ✅ No console errors in browser\n10. ✅ Business logic correct\n11. ✅ Living Apps API rules followed (dates, applookup, response)\n12. ✅ **All features complete** - nothing skipped or left as TODO\n\n---\n\n## Drill-Down: When and How to Use It\n\nDrill-down is useful when there's **more information to show** than fits in the summary view. Don't add it everywhere - only where it adds value.\n\n### When to Use Drill-Down\n\n| Good Use Cases | Skip Drill-Down When... |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| List item → show full record details | The summary already shows everything |\n| Summary count → show the items being counted | It's a simple, self-explanatory number |\n| Record reference → view the related record | There's no additional detail to show |\n\n### Make It Obvious\n\nIf something is clickable, make it visually clear:\n- Hover effect (shadow, background change)\n- Cursor pointer\n- Underline or chevron icon for \"see more\"\n\n### Implementation Pattern: Clickable List Item\n\n```typescript\n// Use when list items have more details to show\n<div\n  className=\"p-3 rounded-lg hover:bg-muted cursor-pointer transition-colors\"\n  onClick={() => setSelectedRecord(record)}\n>\n  <div className=\"font-medium\">{record.name}</div>\n  <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">{record.summary}</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Don't force drill-down everywhere.** A simple KPI that shows \"5 workouts this week\" doesn't need a click handler if there's nothing more to show.\n\n---\n\n## UX Details - Don't Forget!\n\n### Loading States\n```typescript\nif (loading) {\n  return <LoadingState />;  // Use Skeleton, not spinner\n}\n```\n\n### Empty States\n```typescript\nif (data.length === 0) {\n  return (\n    <EmptyState \n      title=\"No data yet\"\n      description=\"Get started by adding your first item\"\n      action={<Button>Add First Item</Button>}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Error States\n```typescript\nif (error) {\n  return (\n    <Alert variant=\"destructive\">\n      <AlertCircle className=\"h-4 w-4\" />\n      <AlertTitle>Error</AlertTitle>\n      <AlertDescription>\n        {error.message}\n        <Button variant=\"outline\" onClick={retry}>Try Again</Button>\n      </AlertDescription>\n    </Alert>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Success Feedback\n```typescript\n// Use toast for success messages\nimport { toast } from '@/components/ui/use-toast';\n\ntoast({\n  title: \"Success!\",\n  description: \"Item saved successfully.\",\n});\n```\n\n### Hover States\n```typescript\n// Cards should have hover feedback\n<Card className=\"hover:shadow-md transition-shadow cursor-pointer\">\n```\n\n---\n\n# Living Apps API Reference\n\n## ⚠️ Critical API Rules\n\nThese rules are **non-negotiable**. Breaking them causes runtime errors.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Date Formats\n\nLiving Apps has strict date format requirements:\n\n| Field Type | Format | Example |\n|------------|--------|---------|\n| `date/datetimeminute` | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` | `2025-11-06T12:00` |\n| `date/date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | `2025-11-06` |\n\n### ❌ WRONG\n```typescript\n// Seconds are NOT allowed for datetimeminute!\nconst date = '2025-11-06T12:00:00';  // ❌ Will fail\n```\n\n### ✅ CORRECT\n```typescript\n// For date/datetimeminute fields\nconst dateForAPI = formData.datum + 'T12:00';  // ✅ YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM\n\n// For date/date fields\nconst dateForAPI = formData.datum;  // ✅ YYYY-MM-DD\n\n// Display in <input type=\"date\">\nconst dateForInput = apiData.datum?.split('T')[0];  // Extract YYYY-MM-DD\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. applookup Fields\n\n`applookup/select` fields store **full URLs** to related records.\n\n### URL Format\n```\nhttps://my.living-apps.de/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\n```\n\n### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Always use extractRecordId()\n\n```typescript\n// ❌ NEVER do this manually\nconst parts = url.split('/');\nconst id = parts[parts.length - 1];  // ❌ Fragile!\n\n// ✅ ALWAYS use the helper function\nimport { extractRecordId } from '@/services/livingAppsService';\n\nconst recordId = extractRecordId(url);\nif (!recordId) return;  // ✅ Always null-check!\n```\n\n### extractRecordId() Implementation\n```typescript\nexport function extractRecordId(url: string | null | undefined): string | null {\n  if (!url) return null;\n  // Extracts last 24 hex characters (Living Apps Record IDs)\n  const match = url.match(/([a-f0-9]{24})$/i);\n  return match ? match[1] : null;\n}\n```\n\n### Creating applookup Values\n```typescript\nimport { createRecordUrl, APP_IDS } from '@/services/livingAppsService';\n\n// When creating/updating records with applookup fields\nconst data = {\n  kategorie: createRecordUrl(APP_IDS.KATEGORIEN, selectedKategorieId),\n};\n\n// createRecordUrl returns:\n// 'https://my.living-apps.de/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}'\n```\n\n### applookup Can Be Null!\n```typescript\n// ❌ WRONG - Will crash if field is null\nworkoutLogs.forEach((log) => {\n  const id = extractRecordId(log.fields.uebung);\n  data[id] = log;  // ❌ Crashes if id is null\n});\n\n// ✅ CORRECT - Defensive programming\nworkoutLogs.forEach((log) => {\n  const id = extractRecordId(log.fields.uebung);\n  if (!id) return;  // ✅ Skip if null\n  if (!data[id]) data[id] = [];\n  data[id].push(log);\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. API Response Format\n\nLiving Apps returns **objects**, not arrays!\n\n### Response Structure\n```typescript\n// API returns:\n{\n  \"690abc123...\": {\n    \"createdat\": \"2025-11-06T10:00:00\",\n    \"updatedat\": null,\n    \"fields\": {\n      \"name\": \"Item 1\",\n      \"value\": 100\n    }\n  },\n  \"690def456...\": {\n    \"createdat\": \"2025-11-06T11:00:00\",\n    \"updatedat\": null,\n    \"fields\": {\n      \"name\": \"Item 2\",\n      \"value\": 200\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### ❌ WRONG Transformation\n```typescript\n// Loses record_id!\nconst items = Object.values(response);  // ❌ No record_id!\n```\n\n### ✅ CORRECT Transformation\n```typescript\n// Use Object.entries() to preserve record_id\nconst items = Object.entries(response).map(([record_id, record]) => ({\n  record_id,  // ← From the key\n  createdat: record.createdat,\n  updatedat: record.updatedat,\n  ...record.fields,\n}));\n```\n\n### Why record_id Matters\n- Required for React `key` prop\n- Required for update/delete operations\n- Required for applookup references\n\n---\n\n## 4. API Authentication\n\n```typescript\nconst headers = {\n  'X-API-Key': API_KEY,  // From environment\n  'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  'Accept': 'application/json',\n};\n```\n\n### Proxy vs Direct URL\n```typescript\n// For API calls (via proxy)\nconst API_BASE = '/api/rest';\n\n// For applookup values (direct)\nconst APPLOOKUP_BASE = 'https://my.living-apps.de/rest';\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. CRUD Operations\n\n### GET All Records\n```typescript\nGET /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records\n```\n\n### GET Single Record\n```typescript\nGET /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\n```\n\n### CREATE Record\n```typescript\nPOST /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"New Item\",\n  \"value\": 100\n}\n```\n\n### UPDATE Record\n```typescript\nPATCH /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"value\": 150  // Only changed fields\n}\n```\n\n### DELETE Record\n```typescript\nDELETE /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\n\n// Note: DELETE also returns JSON, always call response.json()\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Error Handling\n\n```typescript\nasync function callAPI(method: string, endpoint: string, data?: any) {\n  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}${endpoint}`, {\n    method,\n    headers: {\n      'X-API-Key': API_KEY,\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n    },\n    body: data ? JSON.stringify(data) : undefined,\n  });\n\n  if (!response.ok) {\n    const errorText = await response.text();\n    throw new Error(`API Error (${response.status}): ${errorText}`);\n  }\n\n  return response.json();  // Always parse JSON, even for DELETE\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. Metadata Structure\n\n`app_metadata.json` contains the **complete, real metadata from Living Apps REST API**.\n\n**IMPORTANT:**\n- `controls` is an **OBJECT** (not array!)\n- Each control has `identifier`, `label`, `type`, `subtype`, `fulltype`\n- `lookup/select` has `lookup_data` with all options\n- `applookup/select` has `lookup_app` URL to the linked app\n\n```typescript\n{\n  \"appgroup_id\": \"...\",\n  \"appgroup_name\": \"My App Group\",\n  \"apps\": {\n    \"app_identifier\": {\n      \"app_id\": \"...\",\n      \"name\": \"App Display Name\",\n      \"controls\": {\n        \"control_identifier\": {\n          \"identifier\": \"field_name\",      // Use this as field key\n          \"label\": \"Field Label\",          // Use this for UI display\n          \"type\": \"string\",                // Base type\n          \"subtype\": null,                 // or \"select\", \"textarea\", etc.\n          \"fulltype\": \"string/text\",       // Combined: type/subtype\n          \"lookup_data\": [                 // For lookup/select fields\n            { \"key\": \"option1\", \"value\": \"Option 1\" },\n            { \"key\": \"option2\", \"value\": \"Option 2\" }\n          ],\n          \"lookup_app\": \"https://my.living-apps.de/rest/apps/{app_id}\"  // For applookup\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Common Field Types\n| fulltype | TypeScript | Notes |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| `string/text` | `string` | Plain text |\n| `string/textarea` | `string` | Multiline text |\n| `number/number` | `number` | Numeric |\n| `bool/bool` | `boolean` | True/false |\n| `date/date` | `string` | YYYY-MM-DD |\n| `date/datetimeminute` | `string` | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM (NO seconds!) |\n| `lookup/select` | `string` | From predefined list (lookup_data) |\n| `applookup/select` | `string \\| null` | URL to another app's record |\n\n### Using Metadata for UI\n```typescript\n// Use field labels for UI\nconst fieldLabel = metadata.apps.myapp.controls.myfield.label;\n\n// Use lookup_data for Select options\nconst options = metadata.apps.myapp.controls.status.lookup_data;\n// → [{ key: \"active\", value: \"Active\" }, { key: \"done\", value: \"Done\" }]\n```\n\n---\n\n# Code Patterns Reference\n\n## Available Libraries\n\n### shadcn/ui Components\n\nAll shadcn components are pre-installed in `/src/components/ui/`\n\n```typescript\nimport { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from '@/components/ui/card';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport { Badge } from '@/components/ui/badge';\nimport { Input } from '@/components/ui/input';\nimport { Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue } from '@/components/ui/select';\nimport { Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle, DialogTrigger } from '@/components/ui/dialog';\nimport { Table, TableBody, TableCell, TableHead, TableHeader, TableRow } from '@/components/ui/table';\nimport { Skeleton } from '@/components/ui/skeleton';\nimport { Alert, AlertDescription, AlertTitle } from '@/components/ui/alert';\n// etc.\n```\n\n**To find specific components or examples, use shadcn MCP Tools:**\n```\nmcp_shadcn_search_items_in_registries(registries: ['@shadcn'], query: 'chart')\nmcp_shadcn_view_items_in_registries(items: ['@shadcn/card'])\nmcp_shadcn_get_item_examples_from_registries(registries: ['@shadcn'], query: 'card-demo')\n```\n\n### recharts (Charts)\n\nPre-installed!
